# Migration in EU - Statistical project

I explored the dynamics of immigration and emigration in Europe, particularly focusing on migrants' education levels, residence permits, and preferred destination countries. You can find an outcome of my investigation (visualized by different grafs) in the presentation. 

## Possible questions:

What are the educational attainment levels of migrants in Europe?
Which European countries are the primary destinations for immigrants, and what are the trends over recent years?
How do employment conditions differ between migrants and nationals in the EU?
How do the skill levels of migrants compare to those of the native-born population in the EU?

## Datasets
I will use different Eurostat datasets from:
